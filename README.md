# Chess
This C++ chess project uses Object-Oriented Programming to manage an 8x8 board. It features a move validation engine that calculates legal paths for all pieces while preventing illegal moves. The system tracks the game state, detecting check, checkmate, and stalemate to ensure a functional and logic-driven gameplay experience.
